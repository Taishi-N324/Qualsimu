abstract = {Superconducting qubits are solid state electrical circuits fabricated using techniques borrowed from conventional integrated circuits. They are based on the Josephson tunnel junction, the only non-dissipative, strongly non-linear circuit element available at low temperature. In contrast to microscopic entities such as spins or atoms, they tend to be well coupled to other circuits, which make them appealling from the point of view of readout and gate implementation. Very recently, new designs of superconducting qubits based on multi-junction circuits have solved the problem of isolation from unwanted extrinsic electromagnetic perturbations. We discuss in this review how qubit decoherence is affected by the intrinsic noise of the junction and what can be done to improve it.},

Over the past twenty years, the field has matured from a predominantly basic research endeavor to a one that increasingly explores the engineering of larger-scale superconducting quantum systems. Here, we review several foundational elements—qubit design, noise properties, qubit control, and readout techniques—developed during this period, bridging fundamental concepts in circuit quantum electrodynamics and contemporary, state-of-the-art applications in gate-model quantum computation.}",

It starts with a demonstration of how,in these electrodynamic systems, both the superconducting gap and the long-range Coulomb interactions contribute to the existence of collective modesthat have extremely low dissipationand that can be quantized. The chapter also gives in-depth coverage of quantum harmonic oscillators in all their glory from various perspectives. Superconducting qubits are then introduced, starting with the fundamental theory of the Josephson effect and moving on to a presentation of the variety of existing superconducting qubits. Particular attention is given to the dispersive readout of qubits through their interaction with a cavity into which flying modes can be scattered. Finally, the opportunities offered for quantum information processing by employing the cavity as a quantum bus are presented.}",
